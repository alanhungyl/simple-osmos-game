This is an interactive C# game with GUI. The game is a simplified version of the game Osmos (https://www.osmos-game.com/).
It is a group project in a software engineering course. 
The game is done by me and my fellow groupmates, Brian Law, Kristian Cheng and Andy Chung.

How to use:
Download and execute the simple-osmos-game.exe

How to play:
There are 3 kinds of orbs, the Sun, the Player(blue orb) and the Enemies(red orb).
The sun is located in the middle of the screen while the player is spawned randomly.
You can zoom in or out by scrolling the mouse and move by clicking the mouse button.
