# Simple Osmos Game
This is a simplified version of the popular game [Osmos](https://www.osmos-game.com/), developed as a group project for a software engineering course. 
The game was created by a team of four members: myself (Alan Hung), Brian Law, Kristian Cheng, and Andy Chung.

## Game Overview
The game is an interactive C# application with a graphical user interface (GUI). It features a simplified version of the gameplay mechanics found in the original Osmos game.

## Gameplay Mechanics:
There are three types of orbs in the game:
- Sun: Located in the middle of the screen.
- Player (blue orb): Spawned randomly on the screen.
- Enemies (red orbs): Spawned randomly on the screen.
- You can zoom in or out by scrolling the mouse wheel.
- You can move the player orb by clicking the mouse.


## Features
- Simplified physics calculations.
- Interactive GUI for player control and game visualization.
- Random spawning of player and enemy orbs.

## Installation and Setup
- Download the "simple-osmos-game.exe" file.
- Execute the file to run the game.

## Future Improvements
The current version of the game is a simplified prototype. Future improvements may include:
- Implementing more advanced game mechanics, such as scoring, levels, and power-ups.
- Enhancing the visual and audio aspects of the game.
- Adding respawn options for players to try the same level again.
- Improving the overall user experience and game polish.
- Include an in-game tutorial
